# Numbers, arithmetic and basic algebra

## Natural Numbers

### Details

::: defn
The set of positive integers is usually denoted by $\mathbb{N}$, i.e.
$\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,4,....\}$ and is called the set of **natural
numbers**. In some cases the number zero is included as a natural
number, but here we will use the symbol $\mathbb{N}_0$ to denote the
integers 0, 1, 2 and up.
:::

Within this set of numbers it is possible to add and multiply numbers
together. Arithmetic operations are denoted by $+$ for addition and
$\cdot$ (or $\times$) for multiplication. A natural number can also be
raised to the power of a natural number, e.g.
$3^5=3\cdot 3\cdot 3\cdot 3\cdot 3$ or in general
$m^n=m\cdot m \cdot \ldots \cdot m$ ($n$ times).\
When stating general properties of the natural numbers one needs to use
symbols to indicate that the property holds for an arbitrary number. It
is not enough to just write the property for a few numbers. For example,
to declare that one can interchange numbers in a sum, it is not enough
to say $4+3=3+4$ but one must explicitly state \"the addition operator
has the property that any two natural numbers, $n,\ m\in \mathbb{N}$
satisfy $n+m=m+n$\".\
An arbitrary element of $\mathbb{N}$ is most commonly denoted by
$i,\ j,\ n$,or $m$, but any symbol, $a,\ b,\ c, \ldots$, can be used.\
Several rules of arithmetic apply (some by definition, others can be
derived) such as $$\begin{aligned}
ab&=&ba\\
a+b&=&b+a\\
a+bc&=&a+(bc)\\
a(b+c)&=&ab+ac\\
(a+b)+c&=&a+(b+c)\\
(ab)c&=&a(bc)\end{aligned}$$

Subtraction and division are not generally defined. In addition, we
define one integer, $n$, to the power of another, $m$, to mean $n$
multiplied by itself $m$ times:
$n^m=\underbrace{n\cdot n \cdot \ldots \cdot n}{m}$.

::: defn
The power is an **operator** just like addition and multiplication, and
is defined to have higher priority than the other two.
:::

### Examples

::: xmpl
If we have $x=4$ and $y= 2$ and want to evaluate $$x^y+y^x$$ then we
replace the values of x and y in the expression, and evaluate it, taking
care to observe the correct order of operations: $$4^2+2^4=16+16=32.$$

## Starting with R

### Details

To assign values to a variable in R one can use \"$\texttt{<-}$\"or
\"$\texttt{=}$\"; however, these are **NOT** equivalent. Using the
equals sign is confusing and therefore not recommended.

### Examples

::: xmpl
Assigning values to a variable:

    x<-2
    y<-3
    z<-x+y

## The Integers

### Details

::: defn
The set of all integers is denoted by $\mathbb{Z}$, i.e.
$$\mathbb{Z} = \{.., .., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ......\} .$$
:::

::: notes
*Note 1*. Note that within this set it is possible to subtract as well
as add and multiply. Within this set we cannot, however, in general,
perform division.
:::

When preforming multiple mathematical operations within the same
equation, i.e. $79 - 8\cdot 3$, there is a conventional order for which
the operations must be performed.

::: defn
The conventional order of operations for equations with multiple
mathematical operations is referred to as an **operator precedence**.
:::

### Examples

::: xmpl
To compute $79 - 8\cdot 3$ start by multiplying and then subtracting:\
$79 - 8\cdot 3 = 79-24 = 55$
:::

::: xmpl
To compute $15 - (24 + 36)$ we first note that the parentheses
(brackets) imply a precedence; anything inside brackets should be
evaluated first.

Thus, we first add 36 to 24 and then we subtract that from 15.\
15 - (24+36) = 15 - 60 = - 45\
Â 

Note that the answer is a negative number.

## Rational numbers

### Details

::: defn
**Rational numbers** are fractions denoted $p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are
integers. The set of all rational numbers is usually denoted
$\mathbb{Q}$.
:::

::: notes
*Note 2*. Note that every integer is a rational number (obtained by
taking $q=1$).
:::

We can simplify fractions if the numerator and denominator contain
common terms.\
When the rationals are ordered on to a line there are points missing,
i.e. there are \"gaps\", for example there is no rational number $p/q$
such that $(p/q)^2=2$.

### Examples

::: xmpl
$\frac{2}{6}$=$\frac{2}{2 \cdot 3}$=$\frac{1}{3}$
:::

The rational numbers can be put in order along a line as in the figure.

::: xmpl
As an elaborate example of a fraction, consider the evaluation of the
quantity $$\frac{\frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{5}}{\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{2}}$$
:::

::: xmpl
Evaluate $$\frac{\frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{5}}{\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{2}}$$

Solution: We can either start by calculating the numerator

$$\frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{5}$$

or the denominator

$$\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{2}$$.

Here we choose to start with the numerator. The first step is to make
the two fractions in the numerator have a common denominator.

We can either find the least common denominator or use the product of
the two denominators. Here they are the same number, 15.

So the first step is:

$$\frac{2}{3}\cdot \frac{5}{5}+\frac{2}{5}\cdot \frac{3}{3} = \frac{2\cdot 5}{3\cdot 5}+\frac{2\cdot 3}{5\cdot 3} = \frac{10}{15}+\frac{6}{15}$$.

Now it is possible to add the two fractions, which is the second step:

$$\frac{10+6}{15} = \frac{16}{15}$$

Next, the same process has to be performed for the original denominator.

With the same method (LCM - least common multiple) we get:

$$\frac{1\cdot 2}{3\cdot 2}+\frac{1\cdot 3}{2\cdot 3} = \frac{2}{6}+\frac{3}{6} =\frac{5}{6}$$

Then the total answer is:

$$\frac{\frac{16}{15}}{\frac{5}{6}} {=} \frac{16}{15} \cdot \frac{6}{5} = \frac{96}{75}= \frac{96/3}{75/3}=\frac{32}{25}$$

We can see that in the last step of the equation, the factor has been
simplified. To do this we use factoring. Here we obtain:

$$\frac{96}{75}$$ = $$\frac{3\cdot 32}{3\cdot 25}$$

We can now remove \"3\", or the multiplier, as it is on both sides of
the fraction. So we have:

$$\frac{32}{25}$$ = $$\frac{25}{25}+\frac{7}{25} 
=1\frac{7}{25}$$

In step 1 above we used Cross-Multiplication.

::: defn
**Cross-Multiplication** is when we multiple the numerator by the
reciprocal of the denominator.
:::

So in this case we rewrite $$\frac{\frac{16}{15}}{\frac{5}{6}}$$ or
$$\frac{16}{15} \div \frac{5}{6}$$ as
$$\frac{16}{15} \cdot \frac{6}{5}$$

As you can see all we are doing is turning $$\frac{5}{6}$$ upside down:
and multiplying it with $$\frac{16}{15}$$

This gives:

$$\frac{96}{75}$$
:::

In some cases it is possible to draw a **square root** of a fraction
$s=\frac{p}{q}$, i.e. find a number $r\in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $r^2=s$.
The square root is denoted $\sqrt{r}$.

::: xmpl
Consider the expression
$$(\sqrt{\frac{1}{9}} \times 2^4) + (\frac{1}{5} \times \sqrt{25})$$.

To evaluate this expression, first consider separately the two parts on
each side of the plus symbol.

The first part is $$(\sqrt{\frac{1}{9}} \times 2^4)$$ and the second
part is $$(\frac{1}{5} \times \sqrt{25})$$.

In addition, by definition of root,
$$\sqrt{\frac{1}{9}} = \frac{1}{3}$$.

First part:
$$(\sqrt{\frac{1}{9}} \times 2^4) = \frac{1}{3} \times 16 = \frac{16}{3}$$

Second part:
$$(\frac{1}{5} \times \sqrt{25}) = \frac{1}{5} \times 5 = 1$$

Finally, add the first part and the second part:
$$\frac{16}{3} + 1 = \frac{19}{3}$$
:::

::: xmpl
Consider the following fraction example, to be solved step by step:

$$\frac{\frac{4}{2}+(\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{5}{3})}{\frac{2}{6}\div\frac{1}{5}}$$

First we need to be aware of operator precedence, sometimes called
BODMAS (brackets, multiplication/division, then addition/subtraction).

$$(\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{5}{3}) = \frac{5}{12}$$

After solving the bracket we can proceed with adding $$\frac{4}{2}$$ to
$$\frac{5}{12}$$ as there is no other action left for the nominator of
the main fraction. So:

$$\frac{4}{2}+\frac{5}{12}$$

When adding fractions together we first have to find a common
denominator, in this case 12 would work as $$2\cdot6=12$$ So we multiply
both the numerator and the denominator of that fraction by 6 and then
add the two numerators of the fractions together, keeping the same
denominator.

$$\frac{4}{2}+\frac{5}{12}=\frac{4\cdot6}{2\cdot6}+\frac{5}{12}=\frac{24}{12}+\frac{5}{12}=\frac{29}{12}$$

Now we have the top half of the fraction solved. We then proceed with
dividing the two fractions of the bottom half. When dividing fractions
we use the so called cross multiplication technique. This arithmetic
trick is derived from the fact that if you divide a fraction by its
duplicate you get 1. If you multiple a fraction by its reciprocal (it's
reverse) you also get 1. Like so:

$$\frac{1}{2}\div\frac{1}{2}=1$$ and $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{2}{1}=1$$

These functions always provide the same result and therefore we can turn
the fraction we are dividing by upside down and multiply it to the other
fraction as that is usually much easier.\
We can therefore rewrite $$\frac{2}{6}\div\frac{1}{5}$$ as
$$\frac{2}{6}\cdot\frac{5}{1}=\frac{10}{6}$$

We've now solved both halves of the original fraction and can therefore
proceed to solve it, again with the cross multiplication technique as
fractions are after all just divisions:

$$\frac{29}{12}\div\frac{10}{6}=\frac{29}{12}\cdot\frac{6}{10}=\frac{174}{120}$$

Now $$\frac{174}{120}$$ is a pretty bad looking fraction and we'd
preferably like to simplify it.\
To do this we use factoring.

::: defn
**Factoring** essentially means to break a number done into it's
smallest factors or multipliable prime numbers.
:::

In this case we get $$\frac{2\cdot3\cdot29}{2\cdot3\cdot20}$$

These are the smallest prime numbers that can multiply together into 174
and 120 respectively.\
A way of doing this in your head is by first dividing both numbers
(174,120) by two. Which gives us:

$$\frac{2\cdot87}{2\cdot60}$$ and then dividing those numbers (87,60) by
3, since they can't be divided by 2. Dividing by 3 gives you
$$\frac{3\cdot29}{3\cdot20}=\frac{29}{20}$$ which is a lot nicer than
$$\frac{174}{120}$$

The reasoning behind this factoring simplification is that we can remove
multipliers if they are on both sides of a fraction. This is because the
result of a fraction where the numerator and the denominator are the
same is always 1. Like so:

$$\frac{1}{1}=1$$ or $$\frac{2}{2}=1$$ or $$\frac{3}{3}=1$$

The final answer therefore is

$$\frac{\frac{4}{2}+(\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{5}{3})}{\frac{2}{6}\div\frac{1}{5}}=\frac{29}{20}$$

## The real line

### Details

Some obvious numbers, which commonly occur, are not fractions. These are
in between the rational numbers (fractions). Filling in the missing
points to obtain a continuum results in the set of \"real numbers\".\
Denoted by $\mathbb{R}$ the entire set of \"real numbers\" which
corresponds to \"filling in\" the \"missing pieces\" of the line.

### Examples

::: xmpl
If $C$ is the circumference of a circle and $D$ is the diameter and we
define $\pi=\frac{C}{D}$ then $\pi$ is not a fraction.
:::

::: xmpl
One example of a non fraction is the number e (Euler's number) which can
be defined by

$$e = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty }\frac{1}{n!}$$
:::

::: xmpl
If you have a right triangle with unit side length, what is the length
of its hypotenuse and what class of numbers does it belong to?

An isosceles triangle is defined as having adjacent and opposite sides
of same length, connected by a $90^{\circ}$ angle. Unit side length of
these, refers to a side length of $$1$$.

As we have a $90^{\circ}$ angle, we can use Pythagoras' theorem:

$$a^2+b^2=c^2$$

With $$a=adjacent$$ $$b=opposite$$ $$c=hypotenuse$$

So with $$a,b=1$$:

$$c^2=1^2+1^2$$ $$c^2=1+1$$ $$c^2=2$$

We take the square root to get $$c$$

$$c=\sqrt{2}$$

Now that we answered the first part of the question, it needs to be
defined, which class of number $$\sqrt{2}$$ belongs to. $$\sqrt{2}$$ is
an irrational number, and belongs thereby to the set of real numbers
$$\mathbb{R}$$ Real numbers can be imagined as points on an infinitely
long line, which is also called the real line.
